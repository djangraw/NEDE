// WriteLog.cs
//
// This script is in charge of creating a "Log File," a .txt file that contains
// important info about each trial and can be used for analysis at the end
// of the experiment.  This script is just the messenger - other scripts like
// ReplaySession tell it what to write.
//    It's written in C-sharp because that language allows "StreamWriters"
// to write to text files, and JavaScript does not.
//    This script should be placed in the "Standard Assets" folder because 
// Javascript functions can only reference C-Sharp functions if they're  
// compiled first, and the Standard Assets folder is compiled before the
// rest of the project.
//
// Created ~5/2010 by DJ.
