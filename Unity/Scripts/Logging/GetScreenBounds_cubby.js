// GetScreenBounds_cubby.js
//
// This script identifies a rectangular bounding box around the object the script is attached to
// (in screen coordinates).
//    The coordinates of this bounding box can be accessed or written to a text file by other fns.
//    The box is used in analysis to detect which object a subject is looking at.
//    NOTE: This script assumes that the object is inside specifically designed cubbies
// (prefabs named "DoubleCubby") and that the environment only involves hallways
// in the x and z directions.  We also assume that the subject does not go into these cubbies.
// These assumptions save computation time.
//
// - Created ~5/2011 by DJ.
// - Updated 3/13/12 by DJ - got rid of mainMesh
// - Updated 9/13/12 by DJ for v7.0: removed Moving and Popup surpriseLevel functionality 
//   (for code simplicity).
// - Updated 1/8/13 by DJ (_fast): Get screen bounds without screenshots (less accurate, much faster)
// - Updated 2/26/13 by DJ - raycast is transform.right, not transform.forward (since we rotated 90deg).
// - Updated 11/22/13 by DJ - removed moving & popup support
// - Updated 12/17/13 by DJ - Changed name to _cubby. Raycast -transform.up (to point at floor). 
//   Also cleanup, comments
// - Updated 12/18/13 by DJ - calculate dir using objBounds.center, not transform.position
// - Updated 7/29/14 by DJ - Changed Numbers to Constants.
